## About CS 61A:

CS 61A is an introductory course offered by the University of California, Berkeley, aimed at providing students with a solid foundation in computer science. Through lectures, assignments, projects, and exams, students explore key topics such as programming fundamentals, data abstraction, recursion, and algorithm design.

## Course Objectives:

CS 61A aims to:

- Introduce us to the basics of programming using the Python language.
- Develop our understanding of essential computer science concepts such as data abstraction, recursion, and algorithm design.
- Familiarize us with different programming paradigms, including functional and object-oriented programming.
- Cultivate our problem-solving skills through hands-on coding exercises and projects.

## Course Topics:

Throughout the course, it will cover a range of topics including:

- Basic programming constructs such as variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.
- Data structures and their manipulation, including lists, dictionaries, and tuples.
- Functional programming techniques such as higher-order functions and recursion.
- Object-oriented programming principles and concepts.
- Algorithm design and analysis, including iterative and recursive approaches.
- Introduction to the Scheme programming language and its applications.
